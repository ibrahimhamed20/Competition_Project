# Competition Program description

### `How it works:`

1. Registering the names of the teams participating in the competition.
2. Ask questions to the contestants and calculate the points of each question so that after each question the initial results appear:-
  - (When each question is completed, the results are shown, and these results may change from the first question to the second, for example, the first place may become the latter and so on).
  - (The time to answer the question is different from one question to another so that we control the duration of each question).
  - (The transition between each question and question is either automatic or manual (optional: eg press next button) - which we own option).
3. The last results appear automatically after the last question.
